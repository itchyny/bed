## Why?
Why not? Programming is so fun!

I learned so much while creating this editor; handling of file pointers, what the saying details should depend on abstractions mean, how to mock file system for tests in Go language, how to solve deadlock or race conditions between goroutines and many other things.

After all, creating by yourself is the best way to learn how it works.

#### Okay, but why?
I actually want a binary editor with Vim-like user interface, which runs in terminals, portable, fast and with window splitting feature.
I think I started coding for what I want before doing research on existing editors.

## Installation
### Homebrew
```sh
brew install bed
```

### Build from source
```bash
go install github.com/itchyny/bed/cmd/bed@latest
```

## Features
- Basic editing: inserting, replacing, deleting bytes
- Support for large files
- Window splitting
- Partial writing
- Text searching

Note that this software is still in its early stage of development.
Please refer to [#1](https://github.com/itchyny/bed/issues/1) for roadmap.
