## Motivation
I wanted to create a binary editor with Vim-like user interface, which runs in terminals, fast, and is portable.
I have always been interested in various binary formats and I wanted to create my own editor to handle them.
I also wanted to learn how a binary editor can handle large files and allow users to edit them interactively.

While creating this binary editor, I leaned a lot about programming in Go language.
I spent a lot of time writing the core logic of buffer implementation of the editor.
It was a great learning experience for me and a lot of fun.
